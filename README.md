# mdx-deck

Create presentation decks with [MDX][]

```sh
npm i mdx-deck
```

````mdx
# This is the title of my deck

---

# About Me

---

```jsx
<CodeSnippet />
```

---

import Demo from './components/Demo'

## <Demo />

# The end
````

```sh
mdx-deck deck.mdx
```

## Usage

Create an [MDX][] file and separate each slide with `---`.
MDX can use Markdown syntax and render React components with JSX.

### Imports

To import components, use ES import syntax separated with empty lines from any markdown or JSX syntax.

```mdx
import { Box } from 'grid-styled'

<Box color="tomato">Hello</Box>
```

### Theming

A custom theme can be provided by exporting `theme` from the MDX file.

```mdx
export { default as theme } from './theme'

# Hello
```

The theme should be an object based on [styled-system][]'s theme schema.

```js
// example theme.js
export default {
  font: 'Menlo, monospace',
  fontSizes: [16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128],
  colors: {
    text: '#f0f',
    background: '#000',
    link: '#0ff'
  },
  css: {
    // apply any styles to the root element
  }
}
```

### Custom Components

mdx-deck includes default components for MDX, but to provide custom components to the [MDXProvider][], export a `components` object from your MDX file.

```mdx
export { default as components } from './components'

# Custom Components
```

### Layouts

Each slide can include a custom layout around its content.

```mdx
import Layout from './Layout'

# No Layout

---

export default Layout

# Custom Layout
```
